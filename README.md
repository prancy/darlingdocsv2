# Darling Docs

Darling Docs is an application that helps parents connect with teachers and keep track of their progress in class! 
Teachers are able to create reports and input fields such as behavior, daily participation, and homework scores!

# Inspiration:
-My Little Sister, Nikki. She's in grade school and I would love to be able to connect with her teacher and see her progress from far away.
